  title : "About Care Ministries at The United Church"
  content : "Love one another as I have loved you. --- John 15:12


  Our congregation cares deeply for one another, supporting each other in a variety of ways. As we love one another through the ministries of care, we provide encouragement for our church family in both spiritual and emotional ways, to help their relationship grow with our Lord, Jesus Christ.


Whether in times of difficulties or in times of rejoicing, our congregation serves each other through pastoral care, visitations, prayer groups, card ministry, and prayer shawls. 



Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God. --- 2 Corinthians 1:3-4
