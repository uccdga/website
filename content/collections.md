    - name: "Weekly Food Collection"
      content: "The United Church believes in supporting our neighbors. One of the ways we do this is through our food collections. The food is delivered to the food cupboards at Canandaigua Churches in Action [CCIA] and the Salvation Army. 


      These organizations distribute this food to those in need."
    - name: "Church World Service (CWS)"
      content: "When difficult times happen, a kind and loving response can make all the difference.  For several years our church has been a faithful supporter of Church World Service through collections of items for various \'kits\'.


       Church members have made or provided hundreds of colorful cloth bags for school kits which we then fill with basic items needed for learning. We also assemble and provide hygiene kits and emergency cleanup buckets.


        United Church has served as a drop-off point for area churches and organizations to bring their boxed kits which our members then deliver to the CWS truck in Rochester.  From there they are taken it CWS warehouses where they will be ready in emergency response situations."

    - name: "Silent Auction"
      content: "The United Church holds Silent Auctions every other year as a fundraiser for our Mission Trips. Our church generously assists those members going on short term mission trips including our Youth Group trips each summer."
    - name: "Rada Cutlery"
      content: "One of the ways we raise funds for mission trips is by selling RADA Cutlery by catalog and on line through this link to their website. We earn 40% profit on all orders. They have wonderful cutlery, soups and sauces, desserts, utensils, baking pans, gift sets, dips, cheesecake, and cookbooks. Prices are very reasonable."
    - name: "One Great Hour of Sharing"
      content: "taken on Easter Sunday, this offering is applied by the denominations to provide immediate relief and long-term recovery support after natural and humanitarian disasters; equip churches and leaders in disaster preparedness measures; offer assistance to displaced people; and support global development projects that empower communities around the world."
    - name: "Church World Service Blanket Sunday"
      content: "taken in the month of May, CWS provides blankets to those experiencing urgent need in areas of conflict, or natural disaster.  Through the generosity of CWS partner organizations, our most vulnerable neighbors around the world can have fresh linens and clean sleeping quarters. $10 for a single blanket goes a long way."
    - name: "World Mission Offering"
      content: "taken in October and given in part to assist American Baptist International Ministries as they send and support missionaries all over the world to share the gospel of Jesus as they walk alongside underserved peoples and help with education and healthcare, bringing hope, and bringing about needed change and support systems in these areas of chronic need.  The other part goes to Presbyterian Disaster Assistance working quickly with established connections already on the ground - assessing the needs and assisting those who are suddenly finding themselves in unexpected and overwhelming situations."
    - name: "Christmas Joy Offering"
      content: "is given to the American Baptist \"America for Christ\" and \"Retired Ministers and Missionaries\", and also the Presbyterian \"Joy\" offering.  These latter two provide a monetary gift in thanks to our retired missionaries and ministers at Christmas.  \"America for Christ\" donations equip and expand the ABC network of disciple-makers that they, in turn, may equip other Christians in service in individuals and congregations across the US and Puerto Rico."
