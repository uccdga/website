  title : "About Family Ministry at The United Church"
  content : "Family ministry began at the United Church during 2020, when parents were doing more discipling at home than ever before. We resource our parents with tools that equip them to have faith conversations at home, offer families the opportunity to serve locally, and host family fun days, such as visits to a local corn maze or a sledding hill. In addition, in 2022, we will begin to have quarterly intergenerational Sunday School classes."
