  title : "Giving at The United Church"
  content : "A guideline that the Bible offers for the giving of wealth is a tithe. Tithe means 10%, thus ten percent of income goes to the work of the Lord. As a spiritual discipline, giving a percentage of wealth is a valuable method of keeping the Lord always first, and wealth (and all else) in its proper place."
