Virginia joined the church in 1999 with her late husband, Joseph, and became involved in teaching Youth Club Bible classes and Sunday School. She has also served on several Committees, Capital Campaigns, and Boards. After Virginia retired from her career in corporate banking, she came on staff in 2008 as our first Adult Education Director. In 2019 she took on the role of Church Coordinator until Pastor Wade came on board in 2021. She has served as the Director of Special Member Visitation since 2016. Virginia has one daughter, JoAnna, married to Derek, who also grew up in our church! Virginia loves to garden, scrapbook and make cards, read, hike, bake, snowshoe, and travel with friends and family. She also enjoys very fruitful time spent with the ladies in her Small Group Bible Study.
