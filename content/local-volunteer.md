    ## Family Promise
    - name: "Family Promise of Ontario County (FPOC)"
      content: "FPOC unites existing agencies, volunteer organizations and the faith community in Ontario County to provide a pathway for homeless children and their families to secure reliable housing and self-sufficiency.  



      A major tool in this process is to provide temporary housing while families are helped to self-sufficiency.  FPOC currently has seven apartments for families and The United Church has ‘adopted’ one of the Canandaigua apartments.  This means that when a family graduates and moves out to their own apartment, our congregation cleans and resets the apartment for the next family.  This may happen 2-3 times a year.   The congregation is also made aware of individual volunteer opportunities."

    - name: "Canandaigua Churches in Action (CCIA)"
      content: "CCIA is a community combining the resources of 12 area churches (ours is one!) to serve as \"the hands of Christ working together to address the unmet physical and spiritual needs of our neighbors in the greater Canandaigua community by providing direct services, advocacy and education.\"



     Main services are the Food Pantry, Back Packs (partnering w/ the Canandaigua Primary/Elementary school to provide snacks to students on school break), the Resource Room (connecting people with in-house and outside resources), Supply a Smile (free dental services for those not covered by dental insurance), and Jordan Healthcare (primary affordable healthcare).  



     Our church contributes to the mission of CCIA through our collection of non-perishables and personal items (toothpaste, shampoo, etc.) for the food pantry (look for the grocery cart in the welcome center), taking part in the Drive Thru Food Pantries when scheduled, and the Winter Wear Drive.  Volunteers are welcome to serve at the food pantry, dental service days and the resource room depending on need.  



      CCIA is housed in the back of the building at 120 N. Main Street, Canandaigua, (between the 1st United Methodist Church and Wood Library).  For more information on services or volunteering, please see the CCIA website www.churchesinaction.org or the Canandaigua Churches in Action FB page. Or ask Cathy Bush, our church CCIA representative. "
