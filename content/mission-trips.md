    - name: "AMOS Nicaragua"
      content: "AMOS firmly believes that health for all is possible when evidence-based, faith-based. Community-based models are combined to ensure that health services reach the most vulnerable members of our society.  They work closely with American Baptist missionaries and service twenty-five communities in Nicaragua.


      AMOS has a medical clinic to treat the local population. The communities have basic first aid supplies and a supply of medicines. Projects over the years have included the following: Water projects, VBS for the kids, solar installation, first aid training for the Health promoters, helping with documentation of children’s weight and height to track their progress and a variety of construction projects. 


        The United Church has had members participate in early trips to Nicaragua as well as financially contributing to these projects.  The next trip is planned for February 2023!"

    - name: "Living Waters of the World"
      content: "The United Church has long supported Living Waters for the World and its work to provide clean water to all God’s children. Most recently it has engaged with mission partners living in the communities of Cedralito, Limones, and Tabi in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico.  This has included a yearly trip to these communities to install and support water systems.  The next trip is planned for February 2023.


      For the 2022 installation of Tabi, The United Church partnered with the Newark Rotary Club, other Rotarians and members of the Presbytery of Geneva churches and led a team of volunteers that collaborated with community members of Tabi, Quintana Roo, Mexico to construct a building, and install a purified water system for this community of 500 residents. Training was given to community members on health education that emphasizes the importance of hand-washing and essential uses of clean water.


      Living Waters for the World (LWW) trains and equips volunteers to establish and lead mission teams that partner with communities to implement and operate sustainable water purification systems and health education programs. Since 1993 LWW has shared clean water with over 1,000 communities across 26 countries. 


      Working with local in-country leaders, Rotary International considers projects which provide clean water, sanitation, and economic development to communities in need. This new alliance of joining Rotarians with Faith-based volunteers has opened opportunities to work together for common good."

    - name: "Youth Group Work Camp"
      content: "For over 20 years, Youth from the United Church have attended GROUP Work Camp to serve others and show them the love of Christ. These short-term mission trips make long-term impacts on the lives of both those in need and those who assist. Over the years, we have watched our Youth grow in their faith, deepen their relationships, and develop their skills through this yearly tradition. Some have even joined GROUP Work Camp as staff and returned as adults to continue their involvement in these missions!


      In 2022, our church family joined many other congregations in Dexter, Maine. Looking forward, we now prepare to serve residents in Woonsocket, Rhode Island in July 2023."
