      content: "The Rev. Shelvis and Rev. Nancy Smith-Mather are serving Christ together in the republic of South Sudan. Tragically, after the country achieved independence, South Sudan continues with cycles of ethnic and political violence. The Smith-Mathers serve with RECONCILE International, the Presbyterian Church of South Sudan, Across, and the Yei Teacher Training College. Due to insecurity in South Sudan their family has been living in Uganda or on a recent homestay here in the US. Shelvis has been completing studies in peace building at Oxford University. As a letter from them just informs, they are happy to be returned to Africa now living in a suburb of Kampala where their children have started classes in the international school. They feel \"humbled by the opportunity to be a part of building peace, fighting poverty through education, and restoring hope alongside the church in South Sudan.\""
