Georgia and her family began attending the United Church in 1999 and became Choir Director in 2006.  She had attended Philadelphia College of Bible as a piano major and has taught piano privately for 37 years.  She is married to Rob (1987) and has one daughter, Julie (1997).  Georgia enjoys playing the piano every chance she gets (of course!), reading, hiking, scrapbooking, and entertaining family parties.
