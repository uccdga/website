  title : "About Missions and Community Outreach at The United Church"
  content : "We promote the Gospel of Jesus Christ locally, nationally, and internationally, primarily, but not exclusively, through our two denominations, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the American Baptist Churches USA.


    Emphasis is placed on evangelism, social justice, and acts of mercy. We provide both financial and prayer support to missionaries and for mission projects around the world. Members of the church, both adult and youth, bring the love of Christ to others by participating  in mission trips. The United Church helps finance those missions trips.


    On the first Sunday of each month we collect non-profit perishable food items which are given alternately to Canandaigua Churches in Action and The Salvation Army to be distributed locally to those in need."
