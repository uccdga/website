  The United Church connects to two denominations and other local and national ministries. Through its Mission Budget (which is separate from the Operating Budget), the United Church gives over a third of its yearly offerings to ministries outside of its walls. As a member of two denominations, The United Church is unique. It retains language and organizational structure from both denominations. Membership in the United Church can be either denomination (Presbyterian or Baptist) or neither denomination (United).
