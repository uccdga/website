Carolyn has been Financial Secretary since 2008 and Office Secretary since 2012. She and her husband, David, have 4 young adult “kids”, and have been members of the church since 2001. After growing up in Canandaigua, she met David at Vanderbilt University’s School of Engineering and then served as a Naval Officer in the Nuclear Propulsion program. In her free time, she enjoys musical theatre, kayaking, animals of all sorts, and likes a creative challenge baking cakes or sewing costumes.
